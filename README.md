# Urban Routes Automated Testing

## Project Description
This project focuses on automating tests for the Urban Routes application, ensuring that the taxi ordering process functions correctly. The tests are developed using WebDriverIO and JavaScript, which allow for the automation of user interface interactions and verification that key functionalities are operating as expected.

## Technologies and Techniques Used
- **WebDriverIO**: A testing automation framework that allows interaction with web applications through a browser.
- **Mocha**: A testing framework used to structure and execute the tests.
- **Chai**: An assertion library used with Mocha to validate test outcomes.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used to write the tests.
- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment used to set up and run WebDriverIO.
- **npm**: A package manager used to install dependencies and run scripts.

## Instructions to Run the Tests

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository


### Implementation Steps

1. **Create the File**: In the root of your project, create a file named `README.md`.

2. **Copy the Content**: Copy the content from the example above and modify it as necessary for your specific project. Replace "your-username" and "your-repository" with the correct details.

3. **Save the File**: Once youâ€™ve completed the `README.md`, save it and commit it to your repository.

4. **Push the Changes**: Push the changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README.md with project details"
   git push origin main
